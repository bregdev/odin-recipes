<h4>“With a heady mix of Guinness and chocolate, this cake is a grown-up treat. Rich and dark, 
    the velvety bitterness of the Guinness brings out the flavour of the chocolate, so it packs a punch, 
    while lending the sponge a subtle tang. The richness is balanced by the sweetness of the sour cream icing, 
    which makes the cake look like the famous Irish stout – black with a creamy head. Cheers! ”</h4>

    <li>75 g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids)</li>
    <li>200 ml Guinness, plus extra for the icing</li>
    <li>200 g plain flour</li>
    <li>20 g cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 large free-range eggs </li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cube the butter and chop the chocolate.</li>
    <li>Put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water and allow to melt. 
        Remove from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Stir in the Guinness – don’t worry if it seizes or splits, 
        it’ll come back together when mixed with the other ingredients.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Grease a 23cm cake tin with butter.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix the flour, cocoa and baking powder until combined. </li>
    <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for about 3 minutes with an electric mixer until fluffy.</li>
    <li>Beat half the chocolate mixture into the eggs until combined. Add half the flour, 
        then combine again. Repeat with the remaining flour and chocolate.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into the tin and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean. 
        If the top is colouring too much after 30 minutes, cover it with tin foil.</li>
    <li>Take the cake out of the oven, cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.</li>
    <li>For the icing, beat together the sour cream and icing sugar until smooth, then stir in 2 tablespoons of Guinness. 
        If it becomes too loose, add more icing sugar.</li>
    <li>Spread over the cooled cake and serve.</li>
